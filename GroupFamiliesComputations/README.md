In this folder are the computations used to populate the gps_families and gps_special_names tables.


*create_fams*   is the magma code to create the familes

*cyclic_fams*, *dihedral_fams*, *SnAn_fams*, *GLSLPSL_fams*, *quaternion_fams*  are where the data is stored.

So far up to order 2000, except for order 1024  all groups in the following families have been added:

* Cn  cyclic groups
* Dn  dihedral groups
* Sn  symmetric groups
* An  alternating groups
* GL(n,q) general linear
* SL(n,q) special linear
* PSL(n,q) projective special linear
* Qn   generalized quaternion groups
